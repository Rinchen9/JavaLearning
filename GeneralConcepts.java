// Java is platform independent. That is made possible by JVM.

// JVM lives inside JRE (Java Runtime Environment). JRE is included in JDK (Java Development Kit). JDK also includes compilers, debuggers, and tools to create programs. 

/* Class vs Instances
    ~ Classes are the blueprints for the objects we want to create.
    ~ From the blueprint, we can create different types of the object which are instances of that class.
*/

/* Static vs Nonstatic Methods
    ~ Static methods are class methods
    ~ Static methods are called using class name if caller is outside the current class
    ~ Static methods can only access static/class variables

    ~ Nonstatic methods are instance methods
    ~ Nonstatic methods are called using instance name
    ~ Nonstatic methods can access static and nonstatic variables
